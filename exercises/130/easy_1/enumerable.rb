class Tree
  include Enumerable

  def each

  end

end

=begin
Understanding the problem
  - Tree is a custom collection class
  - needs to be modifies to support methods from the Enumerable module

Requirements
  - Required methods for Enumerable
      - each
      - <=> if min, max or sort is used (not specified in the directions)
    - implementation not required, just show methods

=end
